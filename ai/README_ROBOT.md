# 3D Robot Implementation with Lottie

## Overview
This implementation adds a 3D robot/AI effect to the home screen using the "Robot-Bot 3D.lottie" file with a split layout design.

## Features
- **Left Side**: "Developers who build AI" text with enhanced typography and feature highlights
- **Right Side**: Interactive 3D robot using Lottie animations
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Dark Mode Support**: Works with both light and dark themes
- **Fallback Animation**: CSS-based robot if Lottie fails to load

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Since the PowerShell execution policy is restricted, you'll need to install the lottie-react dependency manually:

```bash
# Option 1: Use Command Prompt instead of PowerShell
cmd
cd ai
npm install lottie-react

# Option 2: Use Git Bash or WSL
bash
cd ai
npm install lottie-react

# Option 3: Change PowerShell execution policy (run as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
npm install lottie-react
```

### 2. Verify Lottie File
The Lottie file "Robot-Bot 3D.lottie" is already copied to the `public/` directory and should be accessible at `/Robot-Bot 3D.lottie`.

## Components

### Robot3D.jsx
- **Primary**: Loads and displays the Lottie animation
- **Fallback**: CSS-based robot with hover effects if Lottie fails
- **Interactive**: Hover and click animations
- **Responsive**: Scales appropriately on all devices

### Hero.jsx (Modified)
- **Split Layout**: Text on left, robot on right
- **Grid System**: Uses CSS Grid for responsive layout
- **Animations**: Staggered entrance animations
- **Feature Highlights**: Animated indicators below main text

## How to Test

1. **Install the dependency** (see setup instructions above)

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to the home page** (`/`)

4. **Verify the implementation**:
   - Text "Developers who build AI" should be on the left
   - 3D robot should be on the right
   - Robot should be animated (Lottie) or fallback (CSS)
   - Layout should be responsive on different screen sizes

## Technical Details

### Lottie Integration
- **Dynamic Import**: Avoids SSR issues
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully falls back to CSS animations
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with proper cleanup

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile First**: Single column layout on small screens
- **Tablet**: Maintains proportions with adjusted spacing
- **Desktop**: Full split layout with optimal spacing

### Animation System
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth entrance animations
- **Staggered Effects**: Sequential loading of elements
- **Hover States**: Interactive feedback on user interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Lottie Not Loading
- Check if `lottie-react` is installed
- Verify the Lottie file path in `public/` directory
- Check browser console for errors
- The component will automatically fall back to CSS animations

### Layout Issues
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check for CSS conflicts in global styles
- Verify responsive breakpoints are working

### Performance Issues
- Lottie animations are hardware accelerated
- CSS fallback uses efficient animations
- Consider reducing particle count if needed

## Customization
